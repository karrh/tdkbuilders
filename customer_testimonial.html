		<p>We have had the pleasure to have Tim Karr build out log home in Moscow, Idaho. Our home required a substantial amount of custom log detail, which Tim performed exceptionally well. Tim Karr is a superb craftsman with the skills and knowledge to undertake any home building project form beginning to end with outstanding results.</p>
		<p>His honesty and integrity on the job is something very rarely found in the market today. He is a perfectionist. He is only satisfied with the finest workmanship and quality. He consistently places the homeownerâ€™s best interest as his priority. Tim is truly a gem in the building industry today. Anyone fortunate enough to employ his service will find themselves in a beautiful hand-crafted home.</p>
		<p>His work ethic is superb. He worked on our home seven days a week, ten hours a day, for weeks on end to finish work needing to be done. We could never have built this home without his dedication and expertise.</p>
		<p>Without any reservations, we genuinely recommend Tim Karr as a building contractor to anyone who is looking for quality, honesty, integrity and a tremendous work ethic.</p>
