		<h2>Testimonials</h2>
		<section id="testimonial">
		<p class="para">We have had the pleasure to have Tim Karr build out log home in Moscow, Idaho. Our home required a substantial amount of custom log detail, which Tim performed exceptionally well. Tim Karr is a superb craftsman with the skills and knowledge to undertake any home building project form beginning to end with outstanding results.</p>
		<p class="para">His honesty and integrity on the job is something very rarely found in the market today. He is a perfectionist. He is only satisfied with the finest workmanship and quality. He consistently places the homeownerâ€™s best interest as his priority. Tim is truly a gem in the building industry today. Anyone fortunate enough to employ his service will find themselves in a beautiful hand-crafted home.</p>
		<p class="para">His work ethic is superb. He worked on our home seven days a week, ten hours a day, for weeks on end to finish work needing to be done. We could never have built this home without his dedication and expertise.</p>
		<p class="para">Without any reservations, we genuinely recommend Tim Karr as a building contractor to anyone who is looking for quality, honesty, integrity and a tremendous work ethic.</p>

		<p class="para">The log home in which I live is surely one of the most beautiful in this area, thanks to two builders, one of whom was Tim Karr. This was featured in two major log home magazines, which is indicative of the quality and beauty of the house.</p>
		<p class="para">Tim is an extremely hard worker, honest, punctual and a please to work with. His versatility included not only assisting with stacking logs and the interior finishing, but he also took care of concrete pouring and finishing.</p>
		<p class="para">Tim thinks things through carefully before he acts on them and were I to have another log home constructed, he would be one of the first people I would contact.</p>
